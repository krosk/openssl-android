OpenSSL prebuilt for Android
==================
This is a repackaging of OpenSSL prebuilt for Android via Github Actions.

OpenSSL source code is downloaded at build time from the official repository (https://github.com/openssl/openssl/releases). OpenSSL is under Apache-2.0 License.

The build scripts on this repository root folder are written by pelya (https://github.com/pelya/commandergenius), which includes patches to OpenSSL source code. They fall under the LPGL license.

This repository has slightly patched the above build scripts.
